Create a modern, animated, and responsive website for a robotics club named NEXTRONIX using React, Vite, and JavaScript. The website should follow a dark theme with black as the primary color, incorporating smooth animations and a professional, futuristic aesthetic suitable for a robotics club. Use Tailwind CSS for styling and ensure the site is fully responsive across all devices. Below are the detailed requirements:

1. **Tech Stack**:
   - Framework: React (use JSX, modern JavaScript syntax, and reusable components).
   - Build Tool: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds.
   - Styling: Tailwind CSS for responsive and modern design.
   - Hosting: Generate a single-page HTML application that runs in any browser, using CDN-hosted React and dependencies (e.g., cdn.jsdelivr.net for React, ReactDOM, and Babel).
   - Animations: Use libraries like Framer Motion or CSS animations for smooth transitions and effects.

2. **General Design Guidelines**:
   - Theme: Modern, dark (black primary color, with accents like neon blue, white, or grey for contrast).
   - Animations: Smooth transitions for page loads, hover effects on buttons/cards, and a typing effect for specific text.
   - Responsiveness: Ensure the website is fully responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
   - Navigation: Sticky navbar with a clean, minimal design.

3. **Website Structure**:
   - **Navbar**:
     - Sticky navbar with links: Home, Team, Achievements, Contact Us.
     - Design: Sleek, dark background, hover effects on links, mobile-friendly hamburger menu.
   - **Home/Landing Page**:
     - Header: Display "NEXTRONIX" in bold, futuristic typography (e.g., a sci-fi font like Orbitron).
     - Typing Effect: Below the name, animate the text "New Era of Mechatronix" with a typing effect using a library like `react-typed` or custom JavaScript.
     - Buttons: Two links below the typing text: "Know More" (scrolls to About Us section) and "Connect With Us" (scrolls to Contact Us section).
     - Featured Project: Showcase one robotics project with a card (image, title, short description, and "View Details" link to a dedicated project page).
     - About Us: A brief section (200-300 words) describing NEXTRONIX’s mission, vision, and goals.
     - Social Links: Icons for Instagram, LinkedIn, and GitHub (use FontAwesome or similar for icons) at the bottom of the page.
   - **Achievements Page**:
     - Display three robotics projects as cards (image, title, short description).
     - Each card links to a dedicated page with detailed information (e.g., project overview, technologies used, outcomes, images, and GitHub repository link if applicable).
     - Use hover animations (e.g., scale or shadow effects) on cards.
   - **Timeline Page**:
     - Create a vertical timeline showcasing the club’s journey (e.g., key milestones, projects, or skills learned).
     - Design: A line effect connects each timeline point (use CSS or SVG for the line). Each point includes a year, title, and description.
     - Example milestones: Founding of the club, major projects, competitions won, or workshops conducted.
     - Animate timeline points to fade in or slide in as the user scrolls.
   - **Team Page**:
     - Organized sections for:
       - **Mentors**: List mentors with name, position, email, and social links (LinkedIn, GitHub).
       - **Team Leaders**: President, Vice President, Technical Secretary (name, position, email, LinkedIn, GitHub).
       - **P.R. and Outreach Department**: President and members (name, position, email, LinkedIn, GitHub).
       - **Technical Team**: Members (name, position, email, LinkedIn, GitHub).
     - Display each person in a card with a placeholder image, name, position, and contact info/social links.
     - Use hover animations (e.g., card lift or border glow).
   - **Resources Page**:
     - A section for robotics-related resources (e.g., tutorials, tools, or recommended learning materials).
     - Present resources as cards or a list with brief descriptions and links.
   - **Contact Us Page**:
     - Include a contact section with:
       - Email address for the club.
       - Social media links (Instagram, LinkedIn, GitHub).
       - A simple form alternative (e.g., a "mailto" link or third-party form integration, avoiding `<form>` due to sandbox restrictions).
     - Add a futuristic background or subtle animation (e.g., floating particles).

4. **Specific Features**:
   - **Typing Effect**: On the landing page, animate "New Era of Mechatronix" with a typing effect (use `react-typed` or similar).
   - **Timeline Line Effect**: Use a vertical line (SVG or CSS) to connect timeline points, with dots or icons at each milestone.
   - **Cards**: Use consistent card designs for projects, team members, and resources (e.g., dark background, rounded corners, hover effects like scale or shadow).
   - **Social Links**: Restrict to Instagram, LinkedIn, and GitHub across all relevant sections.

5. **Additional Requirements**:
   - Avoid `<form>` tags for submissions due to sandbox restrictions; use external links (e.g., `mailto` or third-party services) for contact functionality.
   - Use `className` instead of `class` for JSX attributes.
   - Ensure all animations are optimized for performance and do not impact page load times.
   - Include a loading animation or skeleton screen for dynamic content (e.g., project or team data).
   - Use modern JavaScript (ES6+) and Babel for compatibility.
   - Generate a single `index.html` file with all React components, styles, and scripts.
